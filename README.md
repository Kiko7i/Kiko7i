## About me
I'm a two-year master's student from [Intelligent Information Processing Innovation Team](https://xxgcxy.hist.edu.cn/znxxclcxxz/zyjs.htm), [Henan Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.hist.edu.cn/). My research interest includes deep learning, remote sensing, and hyperspectral.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jinliang An](https://xxgcxy.hist.edu.cn/info/1480/8996.htm).
